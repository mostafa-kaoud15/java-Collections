collections are used to store, manipulate, and manage groups of objects.
 Java provides several built-in collection classes and interfaces in the java.util package to facilitate these operations

1 - List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
           ==> Implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.

2 - Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
           ==> Implementations include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

3 - Map: An object that maps keys to values.
            ==> A key is an object that you use to retrieve a value at a later date.
            ==> Implementations include HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

4 - Queue: A collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing.
            ==> Implementations include PriorityQueue and LinkedList (which can be used as a queue).

5 - Deque: A double-ended queue that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.
            ==> Implementations include ArrayDeque and LinkedList
