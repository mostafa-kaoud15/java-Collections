set is unordered, unique, its operation (add , remove , contains)O(1)
* set functions
   - add()
   - addAll()

* it is implemented by (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, treeSet)
* HashSet and LinkedHashSet
 - hashset it is unordered and unique
 - linkedhashset it is ordered and unique

* treeset
  - guarantees log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains)
  - elements of set will be sorted with natural
